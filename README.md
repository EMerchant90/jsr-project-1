# General Assembly JSR Project - Chatbot

## HAL9000
* This chatbot is the alpha version of the HAL 9000 created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Currently HAL greets just me a Good Day.
* I can respond back with a few commands at the moment. Those are below

### Commands
* 'Hello'
* 'How'
* 'On Board'
* 'Open'

### My Approach
* Starter code provided with CSS, HTML and few lines of JS to jumpstart project.
* Created a function with list of class members
* Created a function to have HAL respond back with messages - ala the output.
* Created a function for greeting message.
* Created an if / else statement.
* Worked on changing if / else into a switch statement.

### Unsolved Problems - Beta and MVP Future Updates
* Leverage a for loop for iteration over a collection/object.
* Many small edits and updates to current functionality.
* Using switch statements and indexOf function together.
